# Hi there, I’m Artem 👋  

**Software Engineer**

### 🧠 About
Living in Brazil 🇧🇷  
Here mostly to make something work — preferably with code, not duct tape.  
I design and build backend systems that actually scale — and don’t fall apart under load.  
I like solving problems around **data**, **distributed systems**, and **crypto infrastructure**.
